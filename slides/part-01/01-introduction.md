# PyTorch: A Deep Learning Framework

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

### What is it?

- Open-source deep learning framework
- Developed by Meta AI (formerly Facebook)
- Released in 2016, now under Linux Foundation

<div class="mt-6">

### Key Features

- **Pythonic API** - feels like native Python
- **GPU acceleration** - seamless CUDA support
- **Automatic differentiation** - gradients computed automatically

### PyTorch vs TensorFlow

| Aspect | PyTorch | TensorFlow |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Learning curve | Easier | Steeper |
| Research adoption | Dominant | Less common |
| API style | Pythonic, intuitive | More verbose |

<div class="mt-4 text-sm">

Both frameworks are capable of the same tasks. PyTorch is often preferred for learning and research due to its simpler API.
